## üöÄ Getting started

There are basically 3 things to run when deploying the whole stack:

1. üì° [Install the network requirements](./opentofu/network/README.md)
2. üîí [Deploy a OpenBao instance](./opentofu/openbao/cluster/README.md)
3. ‚ò∏Ô∏è [Bootstrap the EKS cluster and Flux components](./opentofu/eks/README.md)

## üîÑ Flux Dependencies Matter

[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) is a foundational component responsible for deploying all resources as soon as the Kubernetes cluster becomes operational. Below is a diagram that highlights the key dependencies in our setup:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Namespaces-->CRDs;
    CRDs-->Crossplane;
    Crossplane-->EPIs["EKS Pod Identities"];
    EPIs["EKS Pod Identities"]-->Security;
    EPIs["EKS Pod Identities"]-->Infrastructure;
    EPIs["EKS Pod Identities"]-->Observability;
    Observability-->Apps["Other apps"];
    Infrastructure-->Apps["Other apps"];
    Security-->Infrastructure;
    Security-->Observability
```

This diagram can be hard to understand so these are the key information:

- **Namespaces** - Namespaces are the foundational resources in Kubernetes. All subsequent resources can be scoped to namespaces.

- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** - CRDs extend Kubernetes' capabilities by defining new resource types. These must be established before they can be utilized in other applications.

- **Crossplane** - Used to provision the necessary infrastructure components from Kubernetes.

- **EKS Pod Identities** - Created using Crossplane, these IAM roles are necessary to grant specific AWS API permissions to certain applications.

- **Security** - Among other things, this step deploys `external-secrets` which is essential to use sensitive data into our applications


## üèóÔ∏è Crossplane Configuration

### Requirements and Security Concerns

When the cluster is initialized, we define the permissions for the Crossplane controllers using Opentofu. This involves attaching a set of IAM policies to a role. This role is crucial for managing AWS resources.

We prioritize security by adhering to the principle of **least privilege**. This means we only grant the necessary permissions, avoiding any excess. For instance, although Crossplane allows it, I have chosen not to give the controllers the ability to delete stateful services like S3, IAM or Route53. This decision is a deliberate step to minimize potential risks.

Additionally, I have put a constraint on the resources the controllers can manage. Specifically, they are limited to managing only those resources which are prefixed with `xplane-`. This restriction helps in maintaining a more controlled and secure environment.

### How is Crossplane Deployed?

[Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/) allows provisioning and managing Cloud Infrastructure (and even more) using native Kubernetes features. It needs to be installed and set up in three **successive steps**:

1. Installation of the Kubernetes operator.
2. Deployment of the AWS provider, which provides custom resources, including AWS roles, policies, etc.
3. Installation of compositions that will generate AWS resources.

## üì¶ OCI Registry with Harbor

The Harbor installation follows best practices for high availability. It leverages recent Crossplane features such as `Composition functions`:

- A [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) instance.
- Valkey cluster using the Bitnami Helm chart
- Storing artifacts in S3

## üîó VPN connection using Tailscale

The VPN configuration is done within the `opentofu/network` directory.
You can follow the steps described in this [README](/opentofu/network/README.md) in order to provision a server that allows to access to private resources within AWS.

Most of the time we don't want to expose our resources publicly. For instance our platform tools such as `Grafana`, `Harbor` should be access through a secured wire.
The risk becomes even more significant when dealing with Kubernetes' API. Indeed, one of the primary recommendations for securing a cluster is to limit access to the API.

Anyway, I intentionnaly created a distinct directory that allows to provision the network and a secured connection. So that there are no confusion with the EKS provisionning.

## üîë Private PKI with OpenBao

:information_source: OpenBao is an opensource fork of the Hashicorp Vault solution.

The OpenBao instance creation is made in 2 steps:

1. Create the cluster as described [here](/opentofu/openbao/cluster/README.md)
2. Then configure it using [this directory](/opentofu/openbao/management/README.md)

The provided code outlines the setup and configuration of a **highly available, secure, and cost-efficient OpenBao cluster**. It describes the process of creating a OpenBao instance in either development or high availability mode, with detailed steps for initializing the OpenBao, managing security tokens, and configuring a robust **Public Key Infrastructure** (PKI) system. The focus is on balancing performance, security, and cost, using a multi-node cluster, ephemeral nodes with SPOT instances, and a tiered CA structure for digital security.

## üëÅÔ∏è Observability

To effectively **identify issues and optimize performance**, a comprehensive monitoring stack is essential. Several tools are available to provide detailed insights into system health, covering key areas such as metrics, logs, tracing, and profiling. Here's an overview of our current setup:

* **Metrics**: We‚Äôve implemented a combination of VictoriaMetrics and Grafana operators to collect, visualize, and analyze metrics. This stack enables real-time monitoring, custom dashboards, and the ability to configure alerts and notifications for proactive issue management.

* **Logs**: (Coming soon)

## üß™ CI

### Overview

We leverage **[Dagger](https://dagger.io/)** for all our CI tasks. Here's what is currently run:

* Validation of Kubernetes and Kustomize manifests using `kubeconform`
* Validation of Terraform/Opentofu configurations using the [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform)

### üè† Using Self-Hosted Runners

Deploying
This feature can be enabled within the `tooling` kustomization. By leveraging **Self-Hosted GitHub Runners**, we achieve:

- **Access to Private Endpoints**: Directly interact with internal resources that are not publicly accessible.
- **Increased Security**: Run CI tasks within our secure internal environment.

For detailed information on setting up and using GitHub Self-Hosted Runners, please refer to this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners).
