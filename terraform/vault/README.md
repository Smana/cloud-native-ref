# Vault cluster

In designing our production environment for HashiCorp Vault, we prioritized both performance and reliability. This led to several key architectural decisions:

1. Cluster Reliability via Raft Protocol: We're leveraging the raft protocol for its robustness in ensuring cluster reliability. This consensus mechanism is widely recognized for its effectiveness in distributed systems and is particularly crucial in a production environment.

2. Five-Node Cluster Configuration: Best practices suggest a five-node cluster in production for optimal fault tolerance and availability. This setup significantly reduces the risk of service disruption, ensuring a high level of reliability.

3. Ephemeral Node Strategy with SPOT Instances: In a move towards operational flexibility and cost efficiency, we've chosen to treat nodes as ephemeral. This approach enables us to utilize SPOT instances, which are more cost-effective than standard instances. While this might introduce some volatility in node availability, it aligns with our goal of optimizing costs.

4. Data Storage on RAID0 Array: We've opted for a RAID0 array for data storage, prioritizing performance. RAID0 arrays offer faster data access and can enhance overall system performance. However, we are aware that RAID0 does not offer redundancy. To mitigate this risk, we're implementing robust backup strategies and ensuring that critical data is replicated in secure and redundant storage systems.

5. Vault Auto-Unseal Feature: To accommodate the ephemeral nature of our nodes, we've configured Vault's auto-unseal feature. This ensures that if a node is replaced or rejoins the cluster, Vault will automatically unseal, minimizing downtime and manual intervention. This feature is crucial for maintaining seamless access to the Vault, especially in an environment where node volatility is expected.

In conclusion, our architecture for HashiCorp Vault is designed to strike a balance between performance, cost-efficiency, and resilience. While we embrace the dynamic nature of cloud resources for operational flexibility, we remain committed to ensuring data safety and system reliability through strategic architectural choices."

For maximum security, your Root CA should be stored in an offline, air-gapped environment, such as a secure, physically isolated machine, an Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a securely stored USB device.

Generate Vault certificates from the intermediate CA:

```json
{
    "CN": "vault.priv.cloud.ogenki.io",
    "hosts": [
        "vault.priv.cloud.ogenki.io"
    ],
    "key": {
        "algo": "ecdsa",
        "size": 256
    },
    "names": [
        {
            "C": "FR",
            "ST": "France",
            "L": "Paris",
            "O": "KMTX"
        }
    ]
}
```

```console
cfssl gencert -ca intermediate-ca.pem -ca-key intermediate-ca-key.pem -config ca-config.json -profile=ca vault-csr.json | cfssljson -bare vault
