## üöÄ Getting started


1. First of all we need to create the **supporting resources** such as the VPC and subnets using [this directory](../../../network/).

2. It is required to provide OpenBao's certificates (`.tls/openbao.pem`, `.tls/openbao-key.pem` and `ca-chain.pem`). You can create the certificates using [this procedure](pki_requirements.md)
   Store them in AWS¬†SecretsManager using these steps:

   ```bash
    SECRET_NAME="certificates/priv.cloud.ogenki.io/openbao"

    SECRETS_JSONFILE=$(mktemp)
    jq -nr --arg key "$(cat .tls/openbao-key.pem)" --arg cert "$(cat .tls/openbao.pem)" --arg ca "$(cat .tls/ca-chain.pem)" '{"cert":$cert,"key":$key,"ca":$ca}' > $SECRETS_JSONFILE

    # Create secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
    aws secretsmanager create-secret --name $SECRET_NAME --secret-string file:///$SECRETS_JSONFILE --region eu-west-3

    # Clean up
    rm $SECRETS_JSONFILE
    ```

3. Prepare your `variables.tfvars` file:

```hcl
name                             = "ogenki-openbao"                              # Name of your Vault instance
leader_tls_servername            = "bao.priv.cloud.ogenki.io"                    # Vault domain name that will be exposed to users
domain_name                      = "priv.cloud.ogenki.io"                        # Route53 private zone where to provision the DNS records
env                              = "dev"                                         # Environment used to tags resources
mode                             = "dev"                                         # Important: More about this setting in this documentation.
region                           = "eu-west-3"                                   # Where all the resources will be created
enable_ssm                       = true                                          # Allow to access to the EC2 instances. Enabled for provisionning, but then it should be disabled.
openbao_certificates_secret_name = "certificates/priv.cloud.ogenki.io/openbao"   # The name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret containing the OpenBao certificates

# Prefer using hardened AMI
# ami_owner = "3xxxxxxxxx"                              # Account ID where the hardened AMI is
# ami_filter = {
#   "name" = ["*hardened-ubuntu-*"]
# }


tags = {                                              # In my case, these tags are also used to identify the supporting resources (VPC, subnets...)
  project = "cloud-native-ref"
  owner   = "Smana"
}
```

4. Run the command `tofu apply --var-file variables.tfvars`

5. Connect to one of the EC2 instances using SSM and init the OpenBao instance:

Switch to the `root` user
```console
sudo su -
```

Initialize OpenBao as follows

```console
export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true
bao operator init -recovery-shares=1 -recovery-threshold=1
```

You should get an output that contains the `Recovery Key` and the `Root Token`
```console
Recovery Key 1: 0vn2C31WbudlZS6...

Initial Root Token: hvs.LMKRyua5kJJ8...

Success! OpenBao is initialized
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Throughout the entire installation and configuration process, it's essential to securely retain the `root` token. This token should be kept until all user accounts have been created. After this point, for enhanced security, the `root` token must be revoked.

Additionally, the `recovery key` requires careful handling. It should be securely stored in a highly safe location. Use the `recovery key` only in exceptionally rare situations, specifically when there is a need to generate a new `root` token. This key serves as a critical backup mechanism and should be treated with the utmost security.

1. Check that the cluster is working properly using the root token above

```console
bao login
```

In `ha` mode you can also list all the cluster peers (members of the OpenBao cluster)

```console
bao operator raft list-peers
```

you should get an output that looks like that
```console
Node                   Address             State       Voter
----                   -------             -----       -----
i-0ef3177199c5252c6    10.0.0.213:8201     leader      true
i-0ad5039408a66cb2c    10.0.10.226:8201    follower    true
i-0b26df9b89772e4c5    10.0.29.250:8201    follower    true
i-0c7e7cc9590ec721d    10.0.42.25:8201     follower    true
i-0118db2721ee07b6c    10.0.24.141:8201    follower    true
```

You can also check the cluster's status. The important information below is that OpenBao is "Initialized" and not "Sealed".
```console
bao status
Key                      Value
---                      -----
