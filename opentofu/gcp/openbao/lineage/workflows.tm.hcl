# GCP OpenBao lineage — opt-in Terramate scripts.
#
# Why override the global scripts (opentofu/workflows.tm.hcl)?
#   Both clouds share one Terramate run order, so without a guard
#   `terramate script run deploy` from the opentofu/ root would build this
#   stack too. The gate keeps that command an AWS one-shot while GCP is
#   unproven.
#
# How the gate works:
#   $TM_CLOUD not naming gcp             -> echo [skip] + exit 0 (success, so
#                                          sibling stacks are unaffected)
#   $TM_CLOUD=gcp (or a list, or all)    -> run the real sequence
#
#   The double-`$$` escape keeps Terramate from interpolating `${VAR:-default}`;
#   the literal `${...}` must reach bash. `${global.provisioner}` interpolations
#   are intentional (Terramate-evaluated -> "tofu").
#
# Usage:
#   terramate script run deploy                                   # skipped
#   TM_CLOUD=gcp terramate script run deploy               # runs
#   terramate script run --no-tags=opt-in deploy                  # skipped, no env var
#
# Trade-off: these overrides lose Terramate Cloud sync metadata
# (sync_deployment / sync_preview), which are command-level annotations that do
# not compose with a single bash heredoc. Accepted while the gate is temporary;
# removing the gate restores the global scripts and their cloud sync.
